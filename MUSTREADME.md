# 010-StringRecognizer-FSM-VHDL-Linux
This project is a chip design from VHDL code phase to The final chip result including all IC Design flow steps

I divided the project to 3 Parts:
Project 1: VHDL code and Testbench code for the finite state machine of the string recognizer

Project 2: 2.1 FSM synthesis 
           2.2 Boolean network optimization 
           2.3 Library Mapping 
           2.4 Netlist optimization 
           2.5 Netlist visualization 
           2.6 Netlist checking 
           2.7 Delay Simulation 
           2.8 Scan-path insertion 
           2.9 Scan-path Simulation
           
Project 3: 3.1 Floorplanning 
           3.2 Placement 
           3.3 Routing 
           3.4 Post-Layout Verification 
               3.4.1 Layout-vs-Schematics (LVS) 
               3.4.2 Design-Rule Checking 
           3.5 Symbolic-to-Real Conversion
